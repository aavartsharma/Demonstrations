if humanity ever makes contact with alien intelligences, will those aliens posses computers> In science fiction, alien computers are common place. If that's correct, it means there is some way alines can discover computers independently of humans. After all, we'd be very surprised if aliens had independently invented coca-cola or pokemon or the harry portter books. if alines have computers, it's becuase computer s are the answer to a question that naturally occurs to both humans and alien civlizations.

here on earth, the pricncipla origintator of omputers was the englisth mathematicial alan turing. In his paper, published in 1936, Turing wasn't trying to invent a clever gadget or to create an industry. Rather, he was attacking a problem about the nature of mathematics posed by the german mathematician David hilbert in 1928. That sounds abstruse, but it's worth understandin the gist of hilbert and turing's thinking, since it illuminates where computerse come from, and what computer swill become the future.

Still, there’s something discomforting about Turing’s analysis. Might he have missed something in his informal reasoning about what an algorithm is? In 1985, the English physicist David Deutsch suggested a deeper approach to the problem of defining what is meant by an algorithmDavid Deutsch, “Quantum theory, the Church-Turing principle and the universal quantum computer” (1985).. Deutsch pointed out that every algorithm is carried out by a physical system, whether it be a mathematician with paper-and-pencil, a mechanical system such as an abacus, or a modern computer. Deutsch then considered the following question 


In this sense, computers aren’t just human inventions. They are a fundamental feature of the universe, the answer to a simple and profound question about how the universe works. And they have likely been discovered over and over again by many alien intelligences.

Deutsch observed that ordinary, everyday computers based on Turing’s model have a lot of trouble simulating quantum mechanical systemsResearchers such as Yu Manin and Richard Feynman had previously observed this, and as a result had speculated about computers based on quantum mechanics.. In particular, they seem to be extraordinarily slow and inefficient at doing such simulations. To answer his question affirmatively, Deutsch was forced to invent a new type of computing system, a quantum computer

This notation with ∣∣ and ⟩⟩ is called the ket notation, and things like ∣0⟩∣0⟩ are called kets. But don’t be thrown off by the unfamiliar terminology – a ket is just a vector, and when we say something is a ket, all we mean is that it’s a vector.


One of the most common terms is superposition. People will say a state like 0.6∣0⟩+0.8∣1⟩0.6∣0⟩+0.8∣1⟩ is a superposition of ∣0⟩∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩∣1⟩. All they mean is that the state is a linear combination of ∣0⟩∣0⟩ and ∣1⟩∣1⟩. You may wonder why they don’t just say “linear combination” (and sometimes they do), but the reason is pretty much the same reason English-speakers say “hello” while Spanish-speakers say “hola” – the two terms come out of different cultures and different histories.

Another common term is amplitude. An amplitude is the coefficient for a particular state in superposition. For instance, in the state 0.6∣0⟩+0.8∣1⟩0.6∣0⟩+0.8∣1⟩ the amplitude for ∣0⟩∣0⟩ is 0.60.6, and the amplitude for ∣1⟩∣1⟩ is 0.80.8.

 the quantum state of a qubit is a vector of unit length in a two-dimensional complex vector space known as state space.

 Mathematically, this circuit is trivial. But physically it’s far from trivial. In many physical systems, the quantum wire is actually one of the hardest quantum computations to implement!   The reason is that quantum states are often incredibly fragile. If your qubit is being stored in some tiny system – perhaps a single photon or a single atom – then it’s very, very easy to disturb that state. It really doesn’t take much to upset an atom or a photon. And so while quantum wires are mathematically trivial, they can be one of the hardest elements to build in real systems.

That said, there are some systems where quantum wires are easy to implement. If you store your qubit in a neutrino then the state will actually be pretty well preserved. The reason is that neutrinos barely interact with other forms of matter at all – a neutrino can easily pass through a mile of lead without being disturbed

What the Hadamard and similar gates do is expand the range of operations that it’s possible for a computer to perform. That expansion makes it possible for the computer to take shortcuts, as the computer “moves” in a way that’s not possible in a conventional classical computer. And, we hope, that may enable us to solve some computational problems faster.

The surprising answer to this question turns out to be NO! There is, in fact, no way to figure out αα and ββ if they start out unknown. To put it a slightly different way, the quantum state of any system – whether it be a qubit or a some other system – is not directly observable.
