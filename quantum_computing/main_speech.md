for most of our human history mankind technology consisted of our brain, fire and spiky weapons where fire and spiky weapons
become power plants and nuclear weapons while the biggest upgrade was to our brain
[change]
since 1960s computing power of our
brain meachine also known as computers has been grown exponationally allowing them to get faster and 
smaller at the sametime but this process is about to meet it's phycical limit computer parts are approaching size of an 
atom and this is not an exaggeration (moore's law) to understand why, we need clear up some basics

let start with the toughest question i have ever tackled in my journey of computer science , what is a computer?
-----
lets start with basic question of all, what is a computer?
A computer is a programmable device that stores, retrieves, and processes data. The term "computer" was originally 
given to humans (human computers) who performed numerical calculations using mechanical calculators, 
such as the abacus and slide rule. The term was later given to mechanical devices as they began replacing 
human computers. Today's computers are electronic devices that accept data (input), process that data, 
produce output, and stores (storage) the results 

computer is made of simple components doing quite simple things repesenting data , an ALU and a control mechanism, these components contain
modules,which contains logic, which contains transistors, a transistor is the simplest form of a data in a digital eletrical computers, it repesents a bit 
and basically works like a switch that can block electrons from moving in one direction, however with parts getting tinier and tinier quantum physics is making things
tricky. heavily simplfied , as transistors are shriinking to the size of only a few atoms electrons may just transfer themselves to the 
other end of transistors via a process called quantum tunneling, heavily simplfied in a classiscal mechanics a particle can't 
pass a through a obsitcle without enoght energy no matter how many times you repeat the experiment but in quantum realm 
a particle like eletron something can end up on other side of the barrier even without enougth energy this phenomena is called 
quantum tennling we are approaching physical barrier for our technologyical process, to solve this problem scienist are trying use this propeties to there 
advantage by building quantum computers
in classiscal computer bits are the smallest unit of information, quantum computers use qubit which can be set to one or two values 

what is a qubit?
the smallest unit of information in quantum comptuers is a qubit 
a qubit can represents a two level quantum system such as a spin of an atom in a magnetic field or a single photon, qubits have 0
and 1 as there possible basic states, determined by there physical configuration. However, unlike classical bit, 
qubit's state is described by a comnination of the 2 basis states, in the quantum reprealm, the qubit dowsn't have to be 
just one of those state, it can be in any proportions of both states at once, this phenomena is called quantum superposition


what is quantum superposition?
let imagine a cat in a box with a radioactive [] and a redioactive detector if 
radioactive material deca the detector will relase the lever and cat will die from posison
here cat will be die and alive at the sametime can you can't know predict her fate 
only when you open the box you will get to know the state of the cat this phenomena is called superposition
this thorth experiment is called the scrodiger's cat

similliely, a qubit in a superposition of probabilites for states 0 and 1,
and you can't predit which it'll be,but the instant you measure it, it collapses into one of the definite states 
this property of superposition, together with entanglement gives quantum computers
their potential to perfoem certain types of computations far more efficiently than classical computers
for classical bits which can be 2 to the power n differeent configuration at a time out of which one one combination is possible
for qubits in superposition , however, can be in all of those 16 combinations at once. this number grows exponentially with each 
extra qubit, 20 of them can them cab alreasy store a million values in parallel written mathematically as |E> = a|0> + b|1> 
where a and b are complex number that represetn the probability amplitudes of finding the qubit in state |0> or |1>.

quantum gates
The probabilites are given by |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1, just like classical bit can be manuplated with logic gate
qubit can be manuplated with quantum gates this are xgate y gate zgate handamate gate ,mathematically this gate
are just 2x2 matrix which manuplate the qubit to perform sertan calculations,

quantum entanglement
other intuitive property qubit can have is quantum entanglement, this property allow 
them  react to quantum state of it's paired qubit no matter how far they are apart

Applications of Quantum Computers
Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize many fields due to their unique properties. They are particularly promising in areas such as cryptography,
where they could break certain encryption schemes that classical computers cannot efficiently solve. They are also useful in 
optimization problems, drug discovery, and material science, because they can simulate quantum systems naturally, 
something classical computers struggle to do. In machine learning, quantum algorithms could enable faster 
training of complex models, opening new possibilities in AI.

The Catch
Despite all the hype surrounding them, quantum computers are full of obstacles. first of all Qubits the fragile 
building blocks of quantum computers are prone to even smallest nudge from the environment, a stray vibration or a wandering photon,
can knock them out of alignment. This instability is known as decoherence, and avoiding it requires cooling the entire system to 
temperatures near absolute zero while maintaining control with astonishing precision.
though
Hardware has made impressive progress in recent years, shrinking error rates and scaling up the number of qubits. Software, however, 
hasn’t kept pace. We don’t yet have many algorithms where quantum computers outperform classical ones, 
and for most tasks a well-tuned classical machine still runs circles around current quantum prototypes. 
Quantum computers aren’t “faster” in any general sense—they’re only potentially superior for a narrow set of problems where 
quantum properties give them an advantage.

the summary
quantum computers use qubit as represention of a quantum system use superposition to excute calculations 
in parllel and uses quantum gates to manuplate there states and use entanglement to perform calculations
faster than any classical computers today one of the most famous use of quantum computers is bracking
morden encryption using shor's algorithm and in quatum simulation but there still remain challenges 
to create and maintain qubit and there ain't many algorithms which can really harness power
of a quatum computer


Conclusion
depiste the cretisium quantum computers remain tecnoglogical leap forward, quantum computers can open up whole new paradime of computering, 
which can revolutionize science, technology has never failed to amaze us, when alan turing publish his paper on computal numbers
he would have never through this work on a mathmatical discovery will lead to th most important invention of mankind now called computer
similliely we don't know weather quantum computers will be a splized tool or big revolutionize for mankind, we don't know where limits of 
technology are , but we will keep coming up with new discovery and invention to solve our problems and to create a world wih the smallest 
amount of suffering possible, that fits our nature and inspires us to be the best version of ourselves

In conclusion, quantum computers represent a fundamentally new way of processing information. By harnessing superposition and entanglement, they can explore many computational possibilities simultaneously, offering exponential speed-ups for certain problems. While practical, large-scale quantum computing is still in development, the theoretical and experimental progress so far has already opened a window into a future where computing power could surpass classical limits, potentially transforming science, technology, and society.
