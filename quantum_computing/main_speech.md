for most of our human history mankind technology consisted of our brain, fire and spiky weapons where fire and spiky weapons
become power plants and nuclear weapons the biggest upgrade has have to our brain since 1960s computing power of our
brain meachine also known by their boring name computers has been grown exponationally allowing them to get faster and 
smaller at the sametime but this process is about to meet it's phycical limit computer parts are approaching size of an 
atom and this is not an exetration (moore's law) to understand why we need clear up some basics

let start with most basic and also toughest question i have ever tackled in my journeyof computer science, what is a computer?
answer to this question is heavily dependent on era and [person perpective] for example we imagine computers like this (digital computer)
in early 1900s the word 'computer' was referred to humans who computed tedious calculations,so i will stick to morden defination a computer
is made of very simple components doing very simple things repesenting data , an ALU and a control mechanism, this components contains
modules,which contains logic, which contains transistors, a transistors is the simplest form of a data in a digital eletrical computers, it repesents a bit 
and basic works like a switch that can block electrons from moving in one direction, a typical scale for apple sillcon chips 4nm in 
compartion that only 40 hydrogen atoms side by side, however with parts getting tinier and tinier quantum physics re making things
tricky. havily simplfied , as transistors are shriinking to the siw of only a few atoms electrons may just transfre themselves to the 
other end of transistors via a process called quantum tunneling, heavily simplfied in a classiscal mechanics a particle can't 
pass a through a obsitcle without enoght energy no matter how many times you repeat the experiment but in quantum realm 
a particle like eletron something can end up on other side of the barrier even without enougth energy this phenomena is called 
quantum tennling we are approaching physical barrier to solve this problem scienist are trying use this propeties to there 
advantage by building quantum computers

in classiscal computer bits are the smallest unit of information, quantum computers use qubit which can be set to one or two values 
a qubit can represents a two level quantum system such as a spin of an atom in a magnetic field or a single photon, qubits have 0
and 1 as there possible basic states, determined by there physical configuration. However, unlike classical bit, 
qubit's state is described by a comnination of the 2 basis states, in the quantum world, the qubit dowsn't have to be 
just onw of those state, it can be in any proportions of both states at once, this phenomena is calles quantum superposition
but as soon as you test its value let say by sending a photon through a filter it ahs to decide to be either vertically
orhorizontally polarized, so as long as it's unoberver, the qubit is in a superposition of probabilites for 0 and 1,
and you can't predit which it'll be,but the instant you measure it, it collapses into one of the definite states 
this property of superposition, together with entanglement gives quantum computers
their potential to perfoem certain types of computations far more efficiently than classical computers
for classical bits which can be 2 to the power n differeent configuration at a time out of which one one combination is possible
for qubits in superposition , however, can be in all of those 16 combinations at once. this number grows exponentially with each 
extra qubit, 20 of them can them cab alreasy store a million values in parallel written mathematically as |E> = a|0> + b|1> 
where a and b are complex number that represetn the probability amplitudes of finding the qubit in state |0> or |1>.
The probabilites are given by |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1, just like classical bit can be manuplated with logic gate
qubit can be manuplated with quantum gates this are xgate y gate zgate handamate gate ,mathematically this gate
are just 2x2 matrix which manuplate the qubit to perform sertan calculations,


other intuitive property qubit can have is quantum entanglement, this property allow 
them 2 react to quantum state of it's paired qubit no matter how far they are apart

Applications of Quantum Computers
Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize many fields due to their unique properties. They are particularly promising in areas such as cryptography,
where they could break certain encryption schemes that classical computers cannot efficiently solve. They are also useful in 
optimization problems, drug discovery, and material science, because they can simulate quantum systems naturally, 
something classical computers struggle to do. In machine learning, quantum algorithms could enable faster 
training of complex models, opening new possibilities in AI.

The Catch
Despite their potential, quantum computers face significant challenges. beside Qubits being extremely sensitive to their environment, making them prone to errors from even the slightest interference—a problem known as decoherence. Maintaining stable qubits requires extremely low temperatures and precise control. the quantum system should be cold down to temperature absoulte zero there are problem 
quantum software. in resent year quantum hard hardware have seen eromust progress but quantum software had little no progress it seems there isn't many problems where quantum computer can outprform
classical computer  

Conclusion
In conclusion, quantum computers represent a fundamentally new way of processing information. By harnessing superposition and entanglement, they can explore many computational possibilities simultaneously, offering exponential speed-ups for certain problems. While practical, large-scale quantum computing is still in development, the theoretical and experimental progress so far has already opened a window into a future where computing power could surpass classical limits, potentially transforming science, technology, and society.
