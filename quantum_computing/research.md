That’s a fantastic pursuit! Quantum computing is at the intersection of physics, computer science, and mathematics. To build a solid foundation, it helps to break the learning path into **stages** — from the fundamentals to practical programming with quantum computers. I’ll give you a roadmap and suggest resources (many are free) at each step.

## **Roadmap to Learning Quantum Computing**

### **Stage 1: Prerequisites**

Before diving into quantum computing, strengthen these areas:

1. **Linear Algebra**

   * Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, tensor products.
     📚 *Resource:* [3Blue1Brown’s Essence of Linear Algebra (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

2. **Probability & Complex Numbers**

   * Probability distributions, random variables, amplitudes, complex exponentials.
     📚 *Resource:* [Khan Academy – Probability & Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)

3. **Foundations of Computer Science**

   * Classical bits vs qubits, logic gates, algorithms, complexity theory basics.
     📚 *Resource:* [MIT OpenCourseWare – Introduction to Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)

---

### **Stage 2: Quantum Mechanics Fundamentals**

You don’t need to master all of physics, but you do need to understand the basics:

* Superposition & measurement
* Entanglement
* Quantum states (Dirac notation: |ψ⟩ )
* Unitary evolution

📚 *Resources:*

* [Quantum Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers (Stanford, free on edX)](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-yqms1-quantum-mechanics-scientists-and-engineers-1)
* Book: *Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum* by Leonard Susskind

---

### **Stage 3: Core Quantum Computing Concepts**

Now dive into quantum computing proper:

* Qubits and Bloch sphere
* Quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, CNOT, etc.)
* Quantum circuits
* Quantum algorithms (Deutsch-Jozsa, Grover’s, Shor’s)

📚 *Resources:*

* \[Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (Nielsen & Chuang)] → the “Bible” of quantum computing
* [Quantum Computing for the Very Curious (free online textbook by Andy Matuschak & Michael Nielsen)](https://quantum.country/qcvc)

---

### **Stage 4: Practical Quantum Programming**

Hands-on programming is key! You’ll use frameworks to write and run quantum algorithms.

1. **IBM’s Qiskit (Python-based)**
   📚 [Qiskit Textbook (free)](https://qiskit.org/textbook/)
2. **Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (Q#)**
   📚 [Microsoft Learn – Quantum Computing Track](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/quantum-computing-fundamentals/)
3. **Other Platforms:**

   * [Google Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq)
   * [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/)

---

### **Stage 5: Advanced Topics**

Once you’re comfortable with the basics, explore:

* Quantum error correction
* Quantum complexity theory (BQP, QMA, etc.)
* Quantum cryptography (QKD)
* Hardware architectures (ion traps, superconducting qubits, photonic systems)

📚 *Resources:*

* MIT’s [Quantum Computation Course (6.845, lecture notes free)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-845-quantum-complexity-theory-spring-2010/)
* Book: *An Introduction to Quantum Computing* by Phillip Kaye

---

### **Stage 6: Stay Updated**

Quantum computing is fast-moving. To stay current:

* Follow **arXiv.org (quant-ph)** preprints
* Communities like [Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/)
* YouTube channels: *Qiskit*, *Microsoft Quantum*, *MinutePhysics (quantum series)*

---

✅ **Suggested Path if Starting Fresh:**

1. Master **linear algebra + probability**
2. Study **quantum mechanics basics**
3. Work through **Quantum Computing for the Very Curious**
4. Do hands-on coding with **Qiskit Textbook**
5. Read selected chapters of **Nielsen & Chuang**
6. Explore **quantum algorithms + error correction**
